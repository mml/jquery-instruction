This jQuery plugin lets you set default instructional text (such as 'First Name'
or 'Enter your email address') for a text input.  The instructional text goes
away on focus on returns on blur, unless the user has entered some text.
Special styling for inputs currently displaying instructional text (e.g., grey
text) can be assigned to the 'instruction' class.
